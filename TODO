Mappings
- Abandoning the MCP mappings is a bold decision but the right one in my eyes. This is because a) the legality of the old mappings is sketchy
and b) the mappings themselves are now over a decade old, and outdated. Fresh mappings akin to Yarn is the right thing in my eyes.
    - I will still probably apply deobfuscated names directly as opposed to an intermediary system, though I'm less set on this than I was in the past

- Updating TSRG files -- how the hell am I even going to do this? I could use Matcher/Stitch but they primarily support Tiny (why does Fabric have this strange aversion to TSRG
but only in some parts of its toolchain?) Also Matcher being GUI-based makes it hard to automate via Gradle. Not sure why it's not CLI when that seems easy to set up.

- Also how will I update the exceptions file? This is probably way easier. I'm guessing there is a library that sniffs out probable exceptions in code. Gotta look into it.
Blacklist will be updated manually be me, depending on how the old mods for each version change in their class structures.
